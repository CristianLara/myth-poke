Late one night before a CS110 assignment was due, Wes and I got bored of working on the assignment, so we decided to flex our dup2 muscles and created a fun little program which takes credentials and a target as arguments, and proceeds to search the stanford myth machines for your target. If the target is found, it bombards their terminal with a given payload txt, our example being twilight.txt
